Raspi-Shell
===========

Please note: This is an inital development version so nothing has been tested as yet. GitHub is a nice easy way for me to sync all my scripts. Once a stable version is developed this message will be removed and individual development projects will take place in their respective branches until stable.

Shell scripts for configuring the RaspberryPi

To set up simply clone this git repository to your home directory, and run the scripts from the command line (ie. ./install.sh)
